# Corruption
### Description
Defeat the corruption before it changes the land completely.
Convert natural resources to energy, and take back your land!
Left-click your tiles to shield it (transfer energy to it), and right-click to bring up the build menu.
Left-click neutral or corrupted tiles to attack. You can only attack a tile if it is adjacent to a tile your own. Energy from your tiles will flow into the attacked tile.
